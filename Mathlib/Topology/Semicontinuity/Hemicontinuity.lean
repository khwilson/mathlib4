/-- **Sequential characterization of upper hemicontinuity**:
A set-valued function `f : α → Set β` is upper hemicontinuous at `x₀ : α` if for every pair
of sequences `x : ℕ → α` and `y : ℕ → β` such that `x` tends to `x₀` and `y n ∈ f (x n)` and
`y` tends to `y₀ : β`, then `y₀ ∈ f x₀`. This requires that there is some (sequentially) compact
set containing all `f x'` for `x'` sufficiently close to `x`.

This is a partial converse of `UpperHemicontinuousAt.mem_of_tendsto`. -/
